JPForm is a PHP class to make it simple with HTML forms.
It supports input type TEXT, PASSWORD, HIDDEN, TEXTAREA, SELECT, RADIO, CHECKBOXES and of course SUBMIT button.
It can check validation rules for each item.
Those rules are 'required|email|numeric|integer|url'.
You can combine none of several.
When the form is submitted to the same page, values entered by user are refilled to the form.
Have a look to index.php sample page.
Comments are welcome.
