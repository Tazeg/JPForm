JPForm is a PHP class to make it simple with HTML forms.
It supports actually input type TEXT, TEXTAREA, SELECT, RADIO and of course SUBMIT button.
It can check validation rules for each item.
Those rules are 'required|email|numeric|integer|url'.
You can combine none of several.
Have a look to index.php sample page.
Comments are welcome.
